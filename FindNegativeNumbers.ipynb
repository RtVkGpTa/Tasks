    "### 2. Determine Negative Elements in Encoded Qubits \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the integer which has been encoded is negative or not, requires a workaround when encoding the elements. The workaround used here is that if an integer can be encoded in its 2's complement representation, the MSB (Most Significant Bit) can be measured to determine whether the encoded integer is positive or negative. In case of a negative integer, the MSB is always 1, whereas for a positive integer it will be 0. This has been coded into the function itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function (\"find_negative_numbers\" below) when it is encoding a number, firstly it determines the number of qubits for encoding the integers (m) by adding 1 to the length of the bitstring for the maximum or minimum value of the array. (In case when negative integers are present, length of the bitstring can be greater than that of other elements in the array). When 2's complement of each integer is computed w.r.t (2**m - 1), the resulting bitstring is always such that there is a 1 in the MSB, if the integer is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as this is a distinguishing factor, this can be made use of by the function to return whether the array contains a negative integer or not. To do so, we just have to measure the MSB over 1000 shots of the circuit execution, and observe whether the result counts have a '1' or not. If '1' is present, the function returns True, implying the array contains a negative integer , else it returns False."
